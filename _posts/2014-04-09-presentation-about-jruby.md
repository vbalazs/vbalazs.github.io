I gave a presentation about JRuby on [budapest.rb](http://www.meetup.com/budapest-rb/events/171032352/) meetup. You can read about it
on the [company blog](http://digitalnatives.blog.hu/2014/04/08/presentation-about-jruby)
where you can find my slideshow as well.

My next talk will be about
[Truffle AST interpreter framework and the Graal JVM compiler](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/graal/) at Simonyi Conference. Itâ€™s a free conference organized by university
students. I will speak in Hungarian this time :)

The conference is free but you have to register [here](http://konferencia.simonyi.bme.hu).
