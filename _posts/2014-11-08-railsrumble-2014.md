This year, I participated with my collegues in RailsRumble. I wrote a short summary about it on the company blog:

_PS: we are planning to continue the development of Dogtopus, I open sourced the repo on [github](https://github.com/vbalazs/dogtopus).
You can find our planning board on [trello](https://trello.com/b/B3UxMetk/dogtopus)._
