As my first anniversary of living in Barcelona is getting closer I am spending 
some time looking back and re-evaluating my career and life situation. It is
far too easy to stay busy with everyday tasks and miss the big picture.

While I was focusing on my personal development in the past year I kind of 
accepted that it is OK not having a professionally challenging job. However 
this can be a dangerous path, with a trap one can easily fall into: if there 
are no challenges, it must be because we already know everything!

Don't get me wrong I was still learning but that happened outside of daily 
work. I see it more clearly now that I could improve much faster if work hours 
would be aligned with my professional growth as well.

With this in mind I've decided to look for new opportunities. I started my 
research to find companies I want to work for. It was a crucial moment when I 
realized while it's useful, if I want to be honest with myself, I am 
procrastinating on sending the applications. I wanted to know more about my 
fears and fight them. After some self-introspection it turned out that I'm 
afraid of being inadequate and being a failure in general.

On an absolute scale which step of the career ladder am I on? It feels like I 
see some steps below me and the next one or two above me but I don't know 
where this step exactly is in the industry.

If I wanted to sound scientific I would ask where the line is between the 
[impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and the 
[Dunning–Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect).

<a href="https://xkcd.com/1954/">xkcd</a>: "It's actually worst in people who study the Dunning–Kruger effect. We tried to organize a conference on it, but the only people who would agree to give the keynote were random undergrads."

I am convinced that by going through some interviews again will help me cope 
with these feelings. And I want to gain some insights into where I must 
improve.

My biggest challenge now is the first company on the list: [Toptal web developers group](https://www.toptal.com/web).
Their famous [3% filter](https://www.toptal.com/top-3-percent) will give me an 
accurate assessment of my skills on the market. If I can pass, I will be 
confident enough to start a new phase of my life as a freelancer developer.
Have a look on their ruby [hiring guide](https://www.toptal.com/ruby?guide=true#hiring-guide) :)
